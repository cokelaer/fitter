What is it ?
################

The **fitter** package is a Python library used for fitting probability distributions to data. It provides a straightforward and and intuitive interface to estimate parameters for various types of distributions, both continuous and discrete. Using **fitter**, you can easily fit a range of distributions to your data and compare their fit, aiding in the selection of the most suitable distribution. The package is designed to be user-friendly and requires minimal setup, making it a useful tool for data scientists and statisticians working with probability distributions.

Installation
###################

::

    pip install fitter

**fitter** is also available on **conda** (bioconda channel)::

     conda install fitter


Usage
##################

standalone
===========

A standalone application (very simple) is also provided and works with input CSV
files::

    fitter fitdist data.csv --column-number 1 --distributions gamma,normal

It creates a file called fitter.png and a log fitter.log

From Python shell
==================

First, let us create a data samples with N = 10,000 points from a gamma distribution::

    from scipy import stats
    data = stats.gamma.rvs(2, loc=1.5, scale=2, size=10000)

.. note:: the fitting is slow so keep the size value to reasonable value.

Now, without any knowledge about the distribution or its parameter, what is the distribution that fits the data best ? Scipy has 80 distributions and the **Fitter** class will scan all of them, call the fit function for you, ignoring those that fail or run forever and finally give you a summary of the best distributions in the sense of sum of the square errors. The best is to give an example::


    from fitter import Fitter
    f = Fitter(data)
    f.fit()
    # may take some time since by default, all distributions are tried
    # but you call manually provide a smaller set of distributions
    f.summary()
